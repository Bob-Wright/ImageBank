All of the ImageBank gallery diplay code lives in this folder.
All of the images to display are also in this folder.
All the code items use file names that begin with a period or dot and the display code filters them out of the gallery list,
so the code files will need to be renamed from the dotless style here in the repo. And dots all there is to it.
